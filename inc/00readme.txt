The files in this inc (incoming) catalogue
==========================================

(this file is just in order to document what we will forget anyway)
Trond, 22.12.09.



All these are in one way or another candidates to be included
in the smesmj/src/ dictionary, or, if not, then please, 
removed from this catalogue.

inc-sme-*
These files are the ones who serve as input to inc-smesmj-*
Just leave these alone (eventually check them against smesmj.fst
at the bitter end)

inc-smesmj-unknown-*
These files are generated from inc-sme-* by means of sme2smj.fst
(the original sme2smj-lexeme.xfst is in the gt/smj/src folder)
Their smj side is currently not recognised by smj.fst. 
TODO: Check, change the smj side, and add to the smesmj/src files.

inc-smj-adv.txt
Dunno what this is.

inc-smj-ok-oddverbs.txt
Dunno what this is.

inc-smj-pron.txt
inc-smj-unknown-oddverbs.txt
Dunno what this is.

inc_smesmjadj.lexc
This file should be checked and added before the corresponding
inc-smesmj-unknown-adj.txt

smesmj-unkn-verbs.txt
This file should be checked and added before the corresponding
inc-smesmj-unknown-verb.txt

smesmj_uncertain.txt
Well, uncertain. Check.
